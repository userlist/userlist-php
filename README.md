# Userlist PHP [![Build Status](https://github.com/userlist/userlist-php/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/userlist/userlist-php)

This library helps with integrating Userlist into PHP applications.

## Installation

This library can be installed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```bash
composer require userlist/userlist dev-master
```

## Configuration

The only required configuration is the Push API key. You can get your Push API key via the [Push API settings](https://app.userlist.com/settings/push) in your Userlist account.

Configuration values can be set when creating a new push client or via environment variables. The environment takes precedence over values provided during the initialization process.

**Configuration via environment variables**

```bash
USERLIST_PUSH_KEY=401e5c498be718c0a38b7da7f1ce5b409c56132a49246c435ee296e07bf2be39
```

**Configuration during initialization**

```php
$userlist = new \Userlist\Push(['push_key' => '401e5c498be718c0a38b7da7f1ce5b409c56132a49246c435ee296e07bf2be39']);
```

## Usage

Before tracking user or event data, create a new push client. If you configured your push key via environment variables there's nothing to add. Otherwise, see the example above.

```php
$userlist = new \Userlist\Push();
```

### Tracking Users

#### Creating & updating Users

```php
$user = [
    'identifier' => 'user-1',
    'email' => 'user@example.com',
    'properties' => [
        'first_name' => 'Jane',
        'last_name' => 'Doe'
    ]
];

$userlist->users->push($user);

$userlist->user($user); // Alias
$userlist->users->create($user); // Alias
```

#### Deleting Users

```php
$userlist->users->delete('user-1');
$userlist->users->delete($user);
```

### Tracking Companies

#### Creating & updating Companies

```php
$company = [
    'identifier' => 'company-1',
    'name' => 'Example, Inc.',
    'properties' => [
        'industry' => 'Software Testing'
    ]
];

$userlist->companies->push($company);

$userlist->company($company); // Alias
$userlist->companies->create($company); // Alias

```

#### Deleting Companies

```php
$userlist->companies->delete('company-1');
$userlist->companies->delete([ 'identifier' => 'company-1' ]);
```

### Tracking Relationships

#### Creating & updating Relationships

```php
$relationship = [
    'user' => 'user-1',
    'company' => 'company-1',
    'properties' => [
        'role' => 'admin'
    ]
];

$userlist->relationships->push($relationship);

$userlist->relationship($relationship); // Alias
$userlist->relationships->create($relationship); // Alias
```

This is equivalent to specifying the relationship on the user model.

```php
$user = [
    'identifier' => 'user-1',
    'relationships' => [
        [
            'company' => 'company-1',
            'properties' => [
                'role' => 'admin'
            ]
        ]
    ],
];

$userlist->users->push($user);
```

It's also equivalent specifying the relationship on the company model.

```php
$company = [
    'identifier' => 'company-1',
    'relationships' => [
        [
            'user' => 'user-1',
            'properties' => [
                'role' => 'admin'
            ]
        ]
    ],
];

$userlist->companies->push($company);
```

#### Deleting Relationships

```php
$relationship = [
    'user' => 'user-1',
    'company' => 'company-1'
]

$userlist->relationships->delete($relationship);
```

### Tracking Events

```php
$event = [
    'name' => 'project_created',
    'user' => 'user-1',
    'properties' => [
        'name' => 'Example Project',
    ]
];

$userlist->events->push($event);

$userlist->event($event); // Alias
$userlist->events->create($event); // Alias
```

### Sending Transactional Messages

```php
$message = [
    'user' => 'user-1',
    'template' => 'welcome-email',
    'properties' => [
        'account_name' => 'Example, Inc.',
        'billing_plan' => 'Pro',
    ]
];

$userlist->messages->push($message);

$userlist->message($message); // Alias
$userlist->messages->create($message); // Alias
```
